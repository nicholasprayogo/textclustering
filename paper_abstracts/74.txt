Description
We demonstrate a system for flexible querying against text that has been annotated with the results of NLP processing. The system supports self-overlapping and parallel layers, integration of syntactic and ontological hierarchies, flexibility in the format of returned results, and tight integration with SQL. We present a query language and its use on examples taken from the NLP literature.
