Description
The application of machine learning techniques to natural language processing (NLP) has increased dramatically in recent years under the name of “corpus-based,”“statistical,” or “empirical” methods. However, most of this research has been conducted outside the traditional machine learning research community. This special issue attempts to bridge this divide by assembling an interesting variety of recent research papers on various aspects of natural language learning–many from authors who do not generally publish in the traditional machine learning literature–and presenting them to the readers of Machine Learning.
In the last five to ten years there has been a dramatic shift in computational linguistics from manually constructing grammars and knowledge bases to partially or totally automating this process by using statistical learning methods trained on large annotated or unannotated natural language corpora
