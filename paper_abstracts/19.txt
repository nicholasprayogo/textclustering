Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning
Description
The 2011 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning is the fifteenth in the series of annual meetings organized by SIGNLL, the ACL special interest group on natural language learning. CONLL-2011 will be held in Portland, Oregon, USA, June 23-24 2011, in conjunction with ACL-HLT.
For our special focus this year in the main session of CoNLL, we invited papers relating to massive, linked text data. We received 82 submissions on these and other relevant topics, of which 4 were eventually withdrawn. Of the remaining 78 papers, 13 were selected to appear in the conference program as oral presentations, and 14 were chosen as posters. All accepted papers appear here in the proceedings. Each accepted paper was allowed eight content pages plus any number of pages containing only bibliographic references.
